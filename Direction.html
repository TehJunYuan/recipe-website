            </li>
        <li>
            In another shallow dish, beat eggs and 1-1/2 cups water; add 1 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1-1/3 cup flour and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. 
        </li>

            Dip chicken in egg mixture, then place in the flour mixture, a few pieces at a time. Turn to coat.
        </li>
        <li>In a deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375°. Working in batches, fry chicken, several pieces at a time, until golden brown and a thermometer inserted into chicken reads 165°, about 7-8 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
